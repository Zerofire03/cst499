       <p class="text-body"> Nonprofit organizations have never been as necessary as they are now.  
        With the current climate of changing regulations, push to cut costs,
        and the complexities of promoting and seeking donations, organizations today have many challenges in fulfilling their stated mission.  
        The growing need in the corporate market for people with specific skills adds pressure and raises the cost for nonprofit organizations, 
        making it more difficult than ever to find people to fill skills gaps in their own teams.
