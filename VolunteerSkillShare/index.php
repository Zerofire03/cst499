        Elements such as growing income inequality, weather events related to<br/>
        climate change, and reduction of government sponsored services mean<br/>
        <b>nonprofit organizations</b> have never been as necessary as they<br/>
        are now.<br/>
        <br/>
        With the current changing regulations, push to cut costs, and the<br/>
        complexities of promoting and seeking donations, organizations<br/>
        today have many challenges in fulfilling their stated mission.<br/>
        The growing need in the corporate market for people with specific<br/>
        skills adds pressure and raises the cost for <b>nonprofit organizations</b>,<br/>
        making it more difficult than ever to find people to fill skills gaps<br/>
        in their own teams.<br/>
        <br/>
